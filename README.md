# Problem:
In this problem we need to count the sorted inversions of array mean (how far or close the array is from being sorted).<br/>

### Concepts that used:
Binary index tree or Fenwick tree is a fast data structure which represents some numbers in numeric array
(also known as Normal Array) and then we can calculate sum of those numbers in a more efficent way with the time complexity of O (logn) and we
can also update values in a given index with the time complexity of O (logn).
